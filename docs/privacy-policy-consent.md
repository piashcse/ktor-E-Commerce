# Privacy Policy Consents API

    "value": number,
    "description": string
  },
  "data": any
}

## Error Handling

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages:

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `200` | OK - Request successful |
| `201` | Created - Consent record created successfully |

## Business Rules

### Consent Creation
- Policy ID must reference an existing policy in the system
- User consent is automatically linked to the authenticated user
- IP address and user agent are captured automatically from the request
- Duplicate consent records for the same policy may be prevented

### Consent Retrieval
- Users can only access their own consent records
- Policy type filtering is case-sensitive
- Consent records include full audit trail information

### Data Privacy
- Consent records serve as legal documentation for compliance
- IP addresses and user agents are stored for audit purposes
- Consent timestamps use ISO 8601 format in UTC

| Policy Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `PRIVACY_POLICY` | Privacy policy consent |
